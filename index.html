		<!-- Quick description of CSA -->
		<br/>
		<p>
			The <strong> Chinese Students Association </strong> (CSA) is one of the most active student organizations at the University of Michigan, bringing together the Chinese and Chinese-American community. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our purpose is to increase the understanding and awareness about Chinese culture through a variety of social, educational, and political activities throughout the year. Through these events, we hope to create bonds between students of similar backgrounds.  
			Our events include general meetings, guest speakers on culture, holiday festivals, dumpling making, a New Year's Celebration, and more. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			In addition to these events, we also have our very own dance team rXn. rXn combines traditional chinese dance with modern hip-hop. We're always looking for new dancers to join the team. If you're interested, contact us below. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're interested in learning more, feel free to contact us. We're always looking for new members to join, and we're always looking to add more people to our family :)
